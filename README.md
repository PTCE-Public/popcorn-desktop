Visit the project's website at <https://popcorntimece.tk/>.

This project would absolutely **not** be possible without the original developer's hard work into making Popcorn Time what it is today. All credit should go to them, we're just trying to help the community :)

## Getting Involved

Want to report a bug, request a feature, contribute or translate Popcorn Time? We need all the help we can get! You can also join in with our [community](README.md#community) to keep up-to-date and meet other Popcorn Timers.

## Getting Started

If you're comfortable getting up and running from a `git clone`, this method is for you.

If you clone the GitLab repository, you will need to build a number of assets using grunt.

The [master](https://github.com/PTCE-Public/popcorn-desktop/tree/master/) branch which contains the latest release.

#### Quickstart:

### Running

1. `npm install`
1. `npm start`

If you receive '/usr/bin/env: node: No such file or directory' with 'npm start', try running 'ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node', the 'npm start' again.

### Building

1. `npm install`
1. `npm run build:YOUR_OS` For example: `npm run build:osx64` (osx32, osx64, win32, win64, linux32 or linux64)
1. The executables should be in the newly created build/ directory

## Versioning

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, Popcorn Time will be maintained according to the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>-<build>`

Constructed with the following guidelines:

* A new *major* release indicates a large change where backwards compatibility is broken.
* A new *minor* release indicates a normal change that maintains backwards compatibility.
* A new *patch* release indicates a bugfix or small change which does not affect compatibility.
* A new *build* release indicates this is a pre-release of the version.
